This Python application allows the user to visualize sinusoidal signals using user-defined amplitude (A), frequency (f), and phase (Î¸) values. It plots sine and cosine components separately, along with their summed signal.
It also supports Fourier Series analysis (sine-cosine form) by combining three user-defined harmonics (k = 1, 2, 3) and displaying the resulting signal on the same interface.
